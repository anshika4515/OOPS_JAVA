// Types of Polymorphism
// 1. Compile Time Polymorphism
// 2. Run Time Polymorphism


//Polymorphism -> Poly -> Multiple -> Morph -> forms
-> Polymorphism is ability to acquire multiple forms 

Compile Time Polymorphism 
-> Also known as static Polymorphism.
-> To achieve compile time Polymorphism one must have 
different implementations of same method in a class.
-> Done using Method Overloading.


RunTime Polymorphism
-> also known as Dynamic Polymorphism
-> To achieve RunTime Polymorphism in java we must be able to call different versions of the
same method using the same reference variables.
-> These methods must be present in child class and the reference must of parent class

// static method ke liye java reference dehkti hai
// non static methd ke liye java object dekhti hai


// when static method is redefined frm parent to child it is called Mehod Hiding
// when non static methd is redefined from parent to child it is called as Method Overriding.
