Early Binding -> or compile time binding or static binding
Late Binding -> or runtime binding or dynamic binding 

-> EarlyBinding -> If the method being called is a static method, then java selects the method
by looking at the class of the reference used in the call and not the type of object to which 
reference is pointing

-> see in exmpe of EarlyBinding it will be clear


-> Late Binding -> If the method being called is a non-static method
i.e instance method, then java selects the method by considering and type of object,
pointed by the reference and not considering the type of reference itself.

-> will see the object not refrence.
