Difference Between Abstract and Interface

Abstract Class                                                Interface

->Abstract class have both abstract and                     -> Interface can have only abstract methods because by default is have public,
non abstract methods.                                          static , abstract.

->Abstract doesnt support multiple                           -> Interface supports multiple inheritance.  
inheritance.                                                 

(Suppose if if we are using abstract class and the subclass is inheriting any other class thats why we use interface to support multiple inheritance)

-> Abstract can have static,non static,                      -> Interface cant have non-static , non-final variables. because by defaultit take as public and abstract.
final , non final variables.

-> Use abstract keyword to implement.                        -> Use interface to implement.

->Abstract class can provide the implementation              -> Interface cant provide the implementation of
of interface.                                                   abstract class.

-> An abstract class can extend another java                 ->Interface can extends another interface only.
class and implement multiple java interfaces

-> Extended through "extends" keyword.                        -> Extended through keyword "implements"

->Example                                                    -> Example
public abstarct class shape(){                                 interface shape(){
     public abstarct void draw(){                                void draw()          
     }                                                        }
