//Inheritance -> Inheritance is a tchnique using which we can acquire the feature of an
// existing class/object in a newly created class / object. 

//Benifits of inheritance
// -> Reusability
// -> Maintainabitlity


//Terminologies used in inheritance
// Parent - Super - Base class -> OOPS ->the class which is being inherited.
//Child - Derived - Sub class -> this class which inherits

//Types of Inheritance
-> Single
-> Multilevel
-> Multiple
-> Hierarchical
-> Hybrid

-> Java doesnt support Hybrid and Multiple Inheritance
 
1. Single Inheritance -> One class extends another class (one class only)
2. Multiple Inheritance -> Where one class extends more than one class. (two parent class single child class)
3. Multilevel Inheritance -> One class can inherit from a derived class. Hence, the derived class
becomes the base class for the new class
4. Hierarchical Inheritance -> one class is inherited by many sub classes.
4. Hybrid Inheritance -> which is a combination of single and Multiple inheritance.
